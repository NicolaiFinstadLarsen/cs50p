# cs50p
Welcome <br>
An introduction to programming using a language called Python. Learn how to read and write code as well as how to test and “debug” it. <br> 
Designed for students with or without prior programming experience who’d like to learn Python specifically. Learn about functions, arguments, and return values (oh my!); variables and types; conditionals and Boolean expressions; and loops. <br>
Learn how to handle exceptions, find and fix bugs, and write unit tests; use third-party libraries; validate and extract data with regular expressions; model real-world entities with classes, objects, methods, and properties; and read and write files. Hands-on opportunities for lots of practice. <br> 
Exercises inspired by real-world programming problems. No software required except for a web browser, or you can write code on your own PC or Mac. <br>
<br>
<p>
Whereas CS50x itself focuses on computer science more generally as well as programming with C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript, this course, aka CS50P, is entirely focused on programming with Python. <br> 
You can take CS50P before CS50x, during CS50x, or after CS50x. But for an introduction to computer science itself, you should still take CS50x!
