# Emojize

Because emoji aren't quite as easy to type as text, at least on laptops and desktops, some programs support "codes," whereby you can type, for instance, `:thumbs_up:`, which will be automatically converted to üëç. Some programs additionally support aliases, whereby you can more succinctly type, for instance, `:thumbsup:`, which will also be automatically converted to üëç.

See

carpedm20.github.io/emoji/all.html?enableList=enable_list_alias

for a list of codes with aliases.

In a file called `emojize.py`, implement a program that prompts the user for a `str` in English and then outputs the "emojized" version of that `str`, converting any codes (or aliases) therein to their corresponding emoji.

Hints

- Note that the `emoji` module comes with two functions, per [pypi.org/project/emoji][1], one of which is `emojize`, which takes an optional, named parameter called `language`. You can install it with:


        pip install emoji


  [1]: https://pypi.org/project/emoji/

## Demo

## Before You Begin

Log into [cs50.dev][2], click on your terminal window, and execute `cd` by itself. You should find that your terminal window's prompt resembles the below:

  [2]: https://cs50.dev/

    $

Next execute

    mkdir emojize

to make a folder called `emojize` in your codespace.

Then execute

    cd emojize

to change directories into that folder. You should now see your terminal prompt as `emojize/ $`. You can now execute

    code emojize.py

to make a file called `emojize.py` where you'll write your program.

## How to Test

Here's how to test your code manually:

- Run your program with `python emojize.py`. Type `:1st_place_medal:` and press Enter. Your program should output:


        Output: ü•á


- Run your program with `python emojize.py`. Type `:money_bag:` and press Enter. Your program should output:


        Output: üí∞


- Run your program with `python emojize.py`. Type `:smile_cat:` and press Enter. Your program should output:


        Output: üò∏


You can execute the below to check your code using `check50`, a program that CS50 will use to test your code when you submit. But be sure to test it yourself as well!

Green smilies mean your program has passed a test! Red frownies will indicate your program output something unexpected. Visit the URL that `check50` outputs to see the input `check50` handed to your program, what output it expected, and what output your program actually gave.

## How to Submit

In your terminal, execute the below to submit your work.
