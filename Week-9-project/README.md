# What is it?

Backtester is my final project for the cs50p course from Harvards online computer science course.
The backtester is a project I have been wanting to make since i started this course. 

The name really says it all, it's a backtester for a financial instrument. To see if a strategy has an edge in the marked, its normall to backtest it. 

## Why make a backester?

The reason I want to learn to code is data analysis. To do that I have understood that I need an understanding of Pandas and maybe NumPy. Since Pandas is build on NumPy I figuered using Pandas for the tabular data of a financial instrument would be a good start. 

I will also be able to learn some matplot to visually show the returns and what not. Therefor this type of project really check alot of the boxes I am looking to learn.

# The start of my project

I first want to learn some Pandas, so the first days was allocated to research and testing how to use the library. And also do some quick reasearch for simple tradingstrategies which I would be able to implement as code. I also need to find some data, preferably as a .csv file to use in my backtest.

In the end I ended up on one of the sinmplest strategies there is. A SMA crossover.

The reason: I'm not looking to make a profit, I just want to learn Pandas. 

## Starting to learn

I found a datafile I want to use. And I learned how to make a dataframe and print the head and a sample of the dataframe. I can see that there is no headers on the data so I want to make some.

I ended up using the name= argument in the .read method.
